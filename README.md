This package was developed as a tool to aid in learning by showing code as it if it typed, like for example for use in College/University classrooms.

The default behavior is as follows:

  1. Copy or Cut some text from inside the editor
  2. Either press the key-binding (default Alt-Ctrl-V on Windows) or Activate from the Menu Bar (Packages>Copy Paste>Auto Paste)
  3. Let it fly, the package will Paste character by character with a random delay, don't move the cursor or type with keyboard.
  4. Either wait for it to finish OR stop it with the key-binding (default Esc key on Windows) or from the Menu Bar (Packages>Copy Paste>Stop)

Speed of delay can be edited from the settings files.

The gif was made using the [Screen-Recorder](https://github.com/lexcast/screen-recorder) package
